# Core Types

Do these in any order.

This will only show you one failure at a time, and it will tell you how many
passing assertions you have. Read the error message carefully to figure out
which line of the test suite is failing.

Start by running `bundle install` to make sure that you have all of the
software that you need.

The object of this exercise is to make the tests pass.

Start off by running the test file in your terminal. For example if you wanted
to start on the array exercise, you would run this command in the terminal:
`ruby array_test.rb`

This will run the test file and you will get some error. Read the error and
make the changes to the array_test.rb file that you need to. Save the file,
and then re-run it. You can hit the up arrow on your keyboard to have the
terminal bring up the last command you ran.

Specifically, after you've replaced the maybes in the test_empty test in
array_test.rb, it's just predicting what the tests want, and then replacing
the underscores with what you think is required, and running the test file
over again, until you've done so for each of the tests in the file, and they
all pass.

Feel free to change the content of the tests after you have made them all
pass in order to get a better understanding of how things work, and definitely
open up pry and play in there to help you understand how these things work.
